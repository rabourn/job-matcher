# Career Brief

## Career Direction

I've spent the last seven years building my analytics career from junior analyst through to leading a small team at a major bank. I've developed strong foundations in data analysis, visualisation, and stakeholder management, but what excites me most is the work I've done at the edges — building ML models, designing experiments, and turning messy data into products that people actually use. I want to move fully into machine learning engineering or AI product roles over the next 2-3 years, ideally working on problems where the models have tangible real-world impact rather than just optimising ad clicks.

My Master's in Data Science gave me the technical foundations in ML, and my churn prediction work at ANZ proved I can ship models that drive business outcomes. I'm ready for a role where ML is the core of what I do, not a side project I squeeze in between dashboard requests.

## Target Roles
- **Titles:** Machine Learning Engineer, Applied ML Engineer, Data Scientist (ML-focused), AI Product Manager
- **Seniority:** Mid to Senior (I can lead small teams but I'm not looking for Director-level management yet)
- **Industries:** HealthTech, FinTech, Climate/Sustainability — sectors where the data work has direct human impact

## Preferences
- **Work mode:** Remote or hybrid (2 days max in office)
- **Location:** Australia preferred, open to US/UK companies that hire remotely in APAC time zones
- **Organisation type:** Mid-size tech companies or growth-stage startups with established ML teams. I don't want to be the only data person building everything from scratch, but I also don't want to be a cog in a 500-person analytics org.
- **Salary range:** AUD $150,000-$190,000 base, or equivalent. Open to equity-heavy packages at earlier-stage companies.

## Priorities and Values

Impact and growth are my top priorities. I want to work on problems that matter — my most fulfilling work has been the pro-bono analytics I did for the Asylum Seeker Resource Centre and my healthcare modelling at Medibank. I'm looking for an organisation that takes its mission seriously, not just as a line in the pitch deck. I also want to be surrounded by strong ML practitioners I can learn from. I've been largely self-taught on the deep learning side and I know I'd accelerate faster with better mentorship and code review culture.

## Distinctive Strengths

My edge is the combination of strong business communication skills with genuine ML capability. Most ML engineers I've worked with struggle to explain their work to non-technical stakeholders; I've been presenting to C-suite executives for three years. I can translate between the data science team and the business, which means I can identify the *right* problems to solve, not just build technically impressive models for problems nobody has. My healthcare and finance domain experience also gives me an understanding of regulated environments — I know how to work with sensitive data, compliance requirements, and audit trails.

## Constraints and Dealbreakers
- Must offer remote or hybrid work — I won't relocate for a role
- No pure consulting/agency work — I want to build products, not deliver client reports
- No crypto/blockchain companies
- Visa sponsorship not needed (Australian citizen)
- I need a team — solo data hire roles are not for me
